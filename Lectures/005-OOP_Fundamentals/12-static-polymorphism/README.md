## Static Polymorphism

**Static polymorphism** is a type of polymorphism that is resolved at **compile-time** rather than at runtime. It is typically achieved using **templates** or **function overloading** in C++, where the exact method to be called is determined during the compilation process based on the types of the arguments or the template parameters.

Static polymorphism contrasts with **dynamic polymorphism**, where the method to be invoked is determined at runtime, usually using virtual functions and inheritance.

### Key Concepts of Static Polymorphism:

1. **Compile-Time Resolution**: The method or function is chosen during compilation, leading to faster execution because no dynamic dispatch is required.
2. **No Runtime Overhead**: Since the method resolution occurs at compile-time, there is no need for runtime checks or vtables, making static polymorphism more efficient than dynamic polymorphism.
3. **Function Overloading and Template Specialization**: Static polymorphism is typically implemented through function overloading or templates, where multiple methods with the same name exist, but with different parameter types.

### Techniques for Static Polymorphism:

#### 1. **Function Overloading**

In function overloading, multiple functions with the same name but different parameter types are defined. The appropriate function is selected at compile-time based on the types of arguments passed.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void print(int value) {
    std::cout << "Integer: " << value << std::endl;
}

void print(double value) {
    std::cout << "Double: " << value << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    print(10);       // Calls print(int)
    print(10.5);     // Calls print(double)
}
```

In this example, the function `print()` is overloaded, and the correct version is chosen at compile-time based on the type of the argument.

#### 2. **Templates**

Templates allow functions and classes to work with generic types, and the appropriate type is determined at compile-time.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

template<typename T>
void print(T value) {
    std::cout << "Value: " << value << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    print(10);       // Calls print<int>
    print(10.5);     // Calls print<double>
}
```

In this case, the `print()` function works with any type (`T`), and the exact version of the function is instantiated at compile-time based on the argument type passed.

#### 3. **CRTP (Curiously Recurring Template Pattern)**

The **Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP)** is a technique used to implement static polymorphism in C++. It involves a derived class inheriting from a base class that is templated on the derived class itself. This allows compile-time polymorphic behavior.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Base class templated on the derived class
template<typename Derived>
class Base {
public:
    void interface() {
        static_cast<Derived*>(this)->implementation();
    }

    // Default implementation
    void implementation() {
        std::cout << "Base implementation" << std::endl;
    }
};

// Derived class inheriting from Base
class Derived : public Base<Derived> {
public:
    // Override implementation in derived class
    void implementation() {
        std::cout << "Derived implementation" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived d;
    d.interface();   // Calls Derived::implementation() through CRTP
}
```

In this example, `Derived` inherits from `Base<Derived>`, and the method `implementation()` is statically chosen during compile-time without the need for dynamic dispatch. This provides polymorphic behavior without the runtime cost of virtual function calls.

### Advantages of Static Polymorphism:

- **Efficiency**: Since everything is resolved at compile-time, static polymorphism avoids the runtime overhead of virtual function dispatch, making it more efficient for performance-critical applications.
- **Type Safety**: Static polymorphism is type-safe because the type checking happens during compilation, reducing the chances of runtime errors.

### Disadvantages of Static Polymorphism:

- **Code Bloat**: Since each type instantiates a new version of a template or function, static polymorphism can lead to code bloat if many different types are used.
- **Reduced Flexibility**: Unlike dynamic polymorphism, static polymorphism requires that all types and methods be known at compile-time, making it less flexible for situations where runtime behavior needs to be modified.

### Summary:

Static polymorphism is a compile-time mechanism that provides polymorphic behavior through function overloading, templates, or CRTP, allowing for highly efficient code without the runtime overhead associated with dynamic polymorphism. Itâ€™s widely used in situations where performance is critical, such as in template-based programming and libraries like the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).
