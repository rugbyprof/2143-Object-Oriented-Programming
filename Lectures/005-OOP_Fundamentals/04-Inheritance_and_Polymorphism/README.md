## Composition V Inheritance

#### Due: None

## Key Words

The major topic of this lecture was Inheritance Vs Composition. Some other concepts that were mixed in:

- `Polymorphism`
  - `Dynamic Polymorphism` (aka Run Time Polymorphism)
  - `Static Polymorphism` (aka Compile Time Polymorphism)
  - `Overload`
  - `Override`
- Synonyms for classes that **get inherited from**:
  - `Base Class`
  - `Super Class`
  - `Parent Class`
- Synonyms for classes that **do the inheriting**:
  - `Sub Class`
  - `Derived Class`
  - `Child Class`
- Access Specifiers
  - `Public`
  - `Private`
  - `Protected`

The order above matters, meaning, always pair `base` with `sub`, `super` with `derived`, and `parent` with `child`.
