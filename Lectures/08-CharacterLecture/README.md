| :----------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :-: | :-: |
| Strength     | measure of physical power and melee combat effectiveness. |  3  | 18  |
| Dexterity    | measure of agility and ranged combat effectiveness.       |  3  | 18  |
| Constitution | measure of health and resilience.                         |  3  | 18  |

| Charisma     | measure of personality and leadership.                    |  3  | 18  |

## Character Attack Overview

The standard method for generating attribute values for a new character is to roll `four six-sided dice` (**`4d6`**) and sum the three highest rolls, discarding the lowest roll. This is done six times, once for each attribute (`Strength`, `Dexterity`, `Constitution`, `Intelligence`, `Wisdom`, and `Charisma`), resulting in a set of six values that are used to determine the character's abilities.

The average value for a single **`4d6`** roll is `12.244`, and the average value for the sum of the three highest rolls is `12.244 * 3 = 36.732`. This means that the average starting value for a randomly generated attribute using the standard method is around `10-11` (which is the sum of the three highest rolls divided by 3).

However, it's important to note that these are just averages and the actual values can vary widely based on luck and chance. It's also common for Dungeon Masters to allow for alternative methods of generating attribute values, such as point-buy systems or fixed values, to provide more control and balance over character creation.

## Attacking Monsters

In Dungeons and Dragons, characters damage monsters by rolling dice to determine the amount of damage dealt by their attacks. The specific die used depends on the character's weapon or attack, as well as any bonuses or modifiers that apply. Here are some examples of typical characters in Dungeons and Dragons and how they damage monsters:

### Warriors

Fighters typically use melee weapons like swords, axes, and hammers. When they hit a monster with their weapon, they roll a die to determine the amount of damage dealt. The specific die depends on the weapon's damage type and size. For example, a `longsword` might deal **`1d8`** slashing damage, while a `greataxe` might deal **`1d12`** slashing damage. Fighters may also have abilities or feats that allow them to add bonuses to their damage rolls.

### Wizard

Wizards typically use spells to damage monsters. Each spell has its own damage type and die roll, which is determined by the spell's level and the wizard's abilities. For example, the Magic Missile spell deals **`1d4+1`** force damage per missile, while the Fireball spell deals **`8d6`** fire damage to all targets in its area of effect.

### Rogue

Rogues typically use weapons like daggers and short swords, and may also use ranged weapons like `shortbows` or hand crossbows. When they hit a monster with their weapon, they roll a die to determine the amount of damage dealt. The specific die depends on the weapon's damage type and size, but is typically smaller than a fighter's die. For example, a short sword might deal **`1d6`** piercing damage. Rogues also have abilities like Sneak Attack, which allows them to deal extra damage if they hit a target with advantage or if another ally is within 5 feet of the target.

### Cleric

Clerics typically use spells to damage monsters, but may also use melee weapons like `maces` or `warhammers`. Each spell has its own damage type and die roll, which is determined by the spell's level and the cleric's abilities. For example, the Inflict Wounds spell deals **`3d10`** necrotic damage, while the Sacred Flame spell deals **`1d8`** radiant damage.

### Paladin

Paladins typically use melee weapons like swords or maces, and may also use ranged weapons like crossbows. When they hit a monster with their weapon, they roll a die to determine the amount of damage dealt. The specific die depends on the weapon's damage type and size. For example, a `longSword` might deal **`1d8`** slashing damage. Paladins also have abilities like `Divine Smite`, which allows them to deal extra radiant damage if they expend a spell slot.

### Druid

Druids typically use spells to damage monsters, but may also use melee weapons like staffs or scimitars. Each spell has its own damage type and die roll, which is determined by the spell's level and the druid's abilities. For example, the Flame Blade spell deals **`3d6`** fire damage, while the `Thorn Whip` spell deals **`1d6`** piercing damage.

- **Dragon**: A powerful, intelligent monster known for its size and magical abilities. Dragons can breathe fire, ice, acid, or lightning, and can attack with claws, bites, and their powerful tails. They are typically immune to their own element and have high intelligence and perception. Strengths include high strength and magical abilities. Weaknesses depend on the dragon's type, but typically include vulnerability to opposite elements. Typical attack: bite (**`2d10`** piercing damage) or breath weapon (varies by dragon type).

- **Skeleton**: An undead monster animated by magic or necromancy. Skeletons can be armed with swords, bows, or other weapons, and are often weak to radiant damage. Strengths include resistance to some forms of damage and the ability to reassemble themselves. Weaknesses include vulnerability to radiant damage and difficulty in maneuvering over difficult terrain. Typical attack: short sword (**`1d6`** piercing damage).

## Character Generation

In Dungeons and Dragons, the initial character generation process involves rolling dice to determine the character's attributes, which represent their physical and mental abilities. Here are the typical characters in Dungeons and Dragons and the associated attribute values, along with the minimum and maximum values and the average values:

- **Fighter**: Fighters typically have high physical attributes like Strength and Constitution. The minimum value for an attribute is 3, while the maximum value is 18. The average value for each attribute is around 10-11, with the possibility for higher values due to rolling for attribute scores.

- **Wizard**: Wizards typically have high mental attributes like Intelligence and Wisdom. The minimum value for an attribute is 3, while the maximum value is 18. The average value for each attribute is around 10-11, with the possibility for higher values due to rolling for attribute scores.

- **Rogue**: Rogues typically have high Dexterity and decent mental attributes like Intelligence and Wisdom. The minimum value for an attribute is 3, while the maximum value is 18. The average value for each attribute is around 10-11, with the possibility for higher values due to rolling for attribute scores.

- **Cleric**: Clerics typically have high mental attributes like Wisdom and Charisma, and a decent Strength or Constitution attribute. The minimum value for an attribute is 3, while the maximum value is 18. The average value for each attribute is around 10-11, with the possibility for higher values due to rolling for attribute scores.

- **Paladin**: Paladins typically have high physical attributes like Strength and Constitution, and a decent mental attribute like Charisma. The minimum value for an attribute is 3, while the maximum value is 18. The average value for each attribute is around 10-11, with the possibility for higher values due to rolling for attribute scores.

- **Druid**: Druids typically have high Wisdom and Constitution attributes. The minimum value for an attribute is 3, while the maximum value is 18. The average value for each attribute is around 10-11, with the possibility for higher values due to rolling for attribute scores.

During character creation, players typically roll `4 six-sided dice` and discard the lowest roll for each attribute. This generates a score between `3` and `18`, which is then assigned to an attribute. This process is repeated until all six attributes are assigned scores. Some players may use a point-buy system instead, which allows them to purchase attribute scores with a set number of points. The average attribute score for a character using the **`4d6`** method is around `12-13`.

## Walkthrough Character Generation

### Generic Steps

Each of these steps are applied to every character:

1. Roll 4 six-sided dice for each of the six attributes
   - Strength
   - Dexterity
   - Constitution
   - Intelligence
   - Wisdom
   - Charisma
2. Discard the lowest roll for each attribute.
3. Add up the remaining three dice rolls to get the attribute score.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until all six attributes have been generated.

The min's and max's are the same for each class (in our case anyway).

| Attribute    | Min | Max |
| :----------- | :-: | :-: |

## Random Character Generation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>

using namespace std;

// Function to generate a random number between min and max
int random(int min, int max) {
    return rand() % (max - min + 1) + min;
}

int main() {
    // Seed the random number generator
    srand(time(NULL));

    // Array of character names
    string characters[] = {"Warrior", "Wizard", "Rogue", "Cleric", "Paladin", "Druid", "Dwarf", "Elf"};

    // Loop through each character
    for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
        string character = characters[i];

        // Generate random stats for the character
        int strength = random(8, 18);
        int dexterity = random(8, 18);
        int constitution = random(8, 18);
        int intelligence = random(8, 18);
        int wisdom = random(8, 18);
        int charisma = random(8, 18);

        // Output the stats for the character
        cout << character << ":" << endl;
        cout << "Strength: " << strength << endl;
        cout << "Dexterity: " << dexterity << endl;
        cout << "Constitution: " << constitution << endl;
        cout << "Intelligence: " << intelligence << endl;
        cout << "Wisdom: " << wisdom << endl;
        cout << "Charisma: " << charisma << endl;
        cout << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Random Die Rolling

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>

using namespace std;

class Die {
public:
    Die(int num_sides) {
        sides = num_sides;
        srand(time(NULL));
    }

    int roll() {
        return rand() % sides + 1;
    }

private:
    int sides;
};

int main() {
    // Create a Die object for each die type
    Die d20(20);
    Die d12(12);
    Die d10(10);
    Die d8(8);
    Die d6(6);
    Die d4(4);

    // Roll each die type 5 times and output the results
    cout << "D20 rolls:" << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        cout << d20.roll() << endl;
    }
    cout << endl;

    cout << "D12 rolls:" << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        cout << d12.roll() << endl;
    }
    cout << endl;

    cout << "D10 rolls:" << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {

    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Multiple Inheritance

Simple Example of multiple inheritance for a warrior class.

In this example, we have a base `class Character` that defines the basic properties and methods of a character, such as:

- `attack()`,
- `defend()`,
- `getHealth()`.

We also have a `Warrior` class that inherits from `Character` and adds a `charge()` method, as well as a `Weapons` class that defines the basic properties and methods of a weapon, such as `attack()`.

Finally, we have a `WarriorWithWeapon` class that inherits from both `Warrior` and `Weapons`, allowing it to use both the `charge()` method from Warrior and the `attack()` method from `Weapons`. It also adds a `specialAttack()` method that is unique to `WarriorWithWeapon`.

In the `main()` function, we create a `WarriorWithWeapon` object warrior with a name of "Conan", a health of 100, and a weapon of "Sword". We then call the `charge()`, `attack()`, `specialAttack()`, and `defend()` methods of warrior to demonstrate its abilities. We also update its health and output the new health value to show the use of the `setHealth()` and `getHealth()` methods from Character.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Character {
public:
    Character(string name, int health) {
        this->name = name;
        this->health = health;
    }

    void attack() {
        cout << name << " attacks!" << endl;
    }

    void defend() {
        cout << name << " defends!" << endl;
    }

    void setHealth(int health) {
        this->health = health;
    }

    int getHealth() {
        return health;
    }

protected:
    string name;
    int health;
};

class Warrior : public Character {
public:
    Warrior(string name, int health, string weapon) : Character(name, health) {
        this->weapon = weapon;
    }

    void charge() {
        cout << name << " charges into battle with " << weapon << "!" << endl;
    }

private:
    string weapon;
};

class Weapons {
public:
    Weapons(string weapon) {
        this->weapon = weapon;
    }

    void attack() {
        cout << "Attacking with " << weapon << "!" << endl;
    }

private:
    string weapon;
};

class WarriorWithWeapon : public Warrior, public Weapons {
public:
    WarriorWithWeapon(string name, int health, string weapon) : Warrior(name, health, weapon), Weapons(weapon) {}

    void specialAttack() {
        cout << name << " uses a special attack with " << weapon << "!" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    WarriorWithWeapon warrior("Conan", 100, "Sword");

    warrior.charge();
    warrior.attack();
    warrior.specialAttack();
    warrior.defend();

    warrior.setHealth(warrior.getHealth() - 10);
    cout << warrior.getHealth() << " health remaining." << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
