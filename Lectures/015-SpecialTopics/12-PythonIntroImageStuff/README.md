```python
from PIL import Image

# Open the image and convert it to grayscale
img = Image.open('image.png').convert('L')

# Define the ASCII characters to use
ascii_chars = [" ", ".", "*", "+", "=", "@", "%", "S", "#", "M"]

# Resize the image to the desired output size
width, height = img.size
aspect_ratio = height / width
new_width = 120
new_height = int(aspect_ratio * new_width * 0.5)
img = img.resize((new_width, new_height))

# Generate the ASCII art
ascii_art = ""
pixels = img.load()
for y in range(img.height):
    for x in range(img.width):
        pixel_value = pixels[x, y]
        ascii_art += ascii_chars[int(pixel_value / 25)]
    ascii_art += "\n"

# Print the ASCII art
print(ascii_art)

```

In this example code, the Image module from the Pillow library is used to open the input image and convert it to grayscale using the .convert('L') method. The ASCII characters to be used for the output are defined as a list of symbols in order of increasing darkness. The image is then resized to the desired output size, and the ASCII art is generated by iterating through the pixels of the resized image and mapping their brightness values to ASCII characters using the ascii_chars list. Finally, the ASCII art is printed to the console.

Note that the output ASCII art may not look very good if the input image has a lot of detail or if the output size is too small. You may need to experiment with different values for the new_width variable and the ascii_chars list to achieve the desired output.

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont

class MemeGenerator:
    def __init__(self, image_path, top_text, bottom_text):
        self.image_path = image_path
        self.top_text = top_text
        self.bottom_text = bottom_text
        self.image = Image.open(self.image_path)
        self.draw = ImageDraw.Draw(self.image)
        self.width, self.height = self.image.size
        self.font_size = int(self.height / 10)
        self.font = ImageFont.truetype("arial.ttf", self.font_size)

    def generate_meme(self):
        # Draw top text
        top_text_width, top_text_height = self.draw.textsize(self.top_text, font=self.font)
        x = (self.width - top_text_width) / 2
        y = self.height * 0.05
        self.draw.text((x, y), self.top_text, font=self.font, fill=self.get_text_color())

        # Draw bottom text
        bottom_text_width, bottom_text_height = self.draw.textsize(self.bottom_text, font=self.font)
        x = (self.width - bottom_text_width) / 2
        y = self.height * 0.85 - bottom_text_height
        self.draw.text((x, y), self.bottom_text, font=self.font, fill=self.get_text_color())

        # Save the meme
        self.image.save("meme.png")

    def get_text_color(self):
        # Get the average color of the image
        colors = self.image.getcolors(self.width * self.height)
        avg_color = sum([c[0] * c[1][0] for c in colors]) / sum([c[0] for c in colors])

        # Choose black or white text depending on the brightness of the image
        if avg_color > 128:
            return (0, 0, 0)  # black
        else:
            return (255, 255, 255)  # white
```

In this code, the MemeGenerator class takes in three parameters: the image path, top text, and bottom text. The **init** method opens the image file, creates a Draw object, and calculates the font size based on the height of the image. The generate_meme method draws the top and bottom text on the image, centered horizontally and positioned near the top and bottom of the image. The get_text_color method calculates the average color of the image and returns black or white depending on the brightness of the image.

To use this class, you can create an instance of MemeGenerator and call the generate_meme method:

```python
meme = MemeGenerator("image.jpg", "Top text", "Bottom text")
meme.generate_meme()
```

This will generate a new image file named "meme.png" with the specified top and bottom text.
