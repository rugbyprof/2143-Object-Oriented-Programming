Perfect — this is a classic comparison question that separates **Encapsulation** (how things are _implemented and protected_) from **Abstraction** (how things are _presented and simplified_).

Here’s the labeled version with short explanations 👇

### 🧩 **Encapsulation vs Abstraction**

|  #  | Statement                                                                           | Concept           | Explanation                                                                                        |
| :-: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1  | Hides certain methods from users of the class by protecting or making them private. | **Encapsulation** | This controls access to internal details by using access specifiers like `private` or `protected`. |
|  2  | Hides whether an array or linked list is used internally.                           | **Abstraction**   | The user only sees _what_ the structure does, not _how_ it’s implemented.                          |
|  3  | Solves problems at the implementation level.                                        | **Encapsulation** | Encapsulation deals with how code and data are organized and protected within a class.             |
|  4  | Wraps code and data together in a single unit.                                      | **Encapsulation** | This is literally the definition — bundling data (attributes) and methods (behavior) in one class. |
|  5  | Is focused mainly on what should be done, not how.                                  | **Abstraction**   | Abstraction defines the interface — describing behavior without exposing details.                  |
|  6  | Is focused on how it should be done.                                                | **Encapsulation** | Implementation details and data protection are the “how.”                                          |
|  7  | Helps developers design projects more easily at a high level.                       | **Abstraction**   | Abstraction simplifies complex systems so you can think at a conceptual level.                     |
|  8  | Lets a developer use a class without worrying about its internal details.           | **Abstraction**   | The interface hides the implementation, letting users focus only on functionality.                 |
|  9  | Solves problems at the design level.                                                | **Abstraction**   | Abstraction helps plan how parts of a system interact before implementation.                       |
| 10  | Hides the irrelevant details found in the code.                                     | **Abstraction**   | It’s about removing clutter so users only see what matters conceptually.                           |

### 🧠 **Quick Summary**

- **Encapsulation** → _How things are implemented and protected._
- **Abstraction** → _What things do and how they’re presented._

Or in one line:

> Encapsulation hides **data**, Abstraction hides **complexity**.
