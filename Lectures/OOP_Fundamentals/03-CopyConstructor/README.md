## OOP Concept - Copy Constructors and Overloading the Assignment Operator

#### Due: NA

## Copy Constructor

When a class requires us to create a copy constructor, this means the class is dealing with dynamic memory (pointers) and requires whats called a `deep copy`. A `deep copy` copies the values to the new object along with allocating any new memory necessary to ensure seperate copies of the data. A `shallow copy` is when there is no dynamically allocated memory (no pointers) and we can simply let the system copy the values over to the new object without doing anything special.

Let’s compare two classes: one that requires a custom copy constructor and one that does not.

### Class that Does Not Require a Copy Constructor

If a class doesn’t manage dynamically allocated memory or other resources (like file handles or database connections), the default copy constructor provided by the compiler will suffice. The default copy constructor performs a **shallow copy**, which is simply copying each member variable as-is.

##### Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Simple {
public:
    int value;

    Simple(int v) : value(v) {}
    // No need for custom copy constructor
};

int main() {
    Simple obj1(10);
    Simple obj2 = obj1; // Default copy constructor works fine

    std::cout << "obj1 value: " << obj1.value << std::endl;
    std::cout << "obj2 value: " << obj2.value << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

- In this case, the class **does not need** a custom copy constructor because the `int` type can be copied directly (shallow copy).

### Class that Requires a Copy Constructor

When a class manages dynamically allocated resources (like a pointer to memory allocated with `new`), the default copy constructor will perform a shallow copy. This causes **multiple objects** to share the same resource (like the same memory block), which leads to issues like **double deletion** when objects are destructed.

##### Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Complex {
public:
    int* value;

    Complex(int v) {
        value = new int(v); // Dynamically allocate memory
    }

    // Custom copy constructor to handle deep copy
    Complex(const Complex& other) {
        value = new int(*other.value); // Allocate new memory and copy the value
    }

    ~Complex() {
        delete value; // Free the dynamically allocated memory
    }
};

int main() {
    Complex obj1(10);
    Complex obj2 = obj1; // Calls the custom copy constructor

    std::cout << "obj1 value: " << *obj1.value << std::endl;
    std::cout << "obj2 value: " << *obj2.value << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

- In this case, a custom **copy constructor is required** to handle a **deep copy** of the dynamically allocated memory. Without it, both `obj1` and `obj2` would share the same memory address, leading to problems like double-freeing memory when the destructor is called.

## Assignment Operator

### When to Overload the Assignment Operator (`operator=`)

The **assignment operator** is called when an object is assigned the value of another object after it has already been created. Just like the copy constructor, the default assignment operator performs a shallow copy of the member variables. You should overload the assignment operator when:

1. **Your class manages resources that require deep copies** (e.g., dynamic memory, file handles).
2. **The default behavior could lead to resource management issues**, like double deletion or memory leaks.

#### Basic Views on When to Overload:

- **Overload the assignment operator** when your class needs custom behavior to correctly copy resources. This is similar to when you would need a custom copy constructor.
- **The Rule of Three**: If your class needs a custom destructor, copy constructor, or assignment operator, it usually needs all three to manage resources correctly.

#### Example of Overloading the Assignment Operator:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Complex {
public:
    int* value;

    Complex(int v) {
        value = new int(v);
    }

    // Custom copy constructor
    Complex(const Complex& other) {
        value = new int(*other.value);
    }

    // Overloaded assignment operator for deep copy
    Complex& operator=(const Complex& other) {
        if (this == &other) return *this; // Handle self-assignment
        delete value; // Clean up old memory
        value = new int(*other.value); // Allocate new memory and copy
        return *this;
    }

    ~Complex() {
        delete value;
    }
};

int main() {
    Complex obj1(10);
    Complex obj2(20);

    obj2 = obj1; // Calls the assignment operator

    std::cout << "obj1 value: " << *obj1.value << std::endl;
    std::cout << "obj2 value: " << *obj2.value << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### When Overloading is Necessary:

1. **Self-assignment handling**: The assignment operator should check for self-assignment (`if (this == &other)`) to avoid deleting and re-allocating the same object.
2. **Resource management**: The assignment operator should handle deep copying of resources like dynamically allocated memory to avoid resource leaks or double-free errors.
3. **Rule of Three**: If a class requires a custom destructor or copy constructor, you likely need to overload the assignment operator to ensure consistent resource management.

### Conclusion:

- **Copy Constructor**: Needed when your class manages dynamic resources and the default shallow copy won’t suffice.
- **Assignment Operator**: Overload it if your class manages resources like dynamically allocated memory, and be careful to handle self-assignment and resource management correctly.
