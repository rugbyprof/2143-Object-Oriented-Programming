# Downloadable Word Lists

This collection of downloadable English word lists exists for one simple reason: **realistic programs need realistic data.** Whether you‚Äôre building a spell-checker, doing text mining, creating a crossword generator, or just want to test your string algorithms with something more challenging than `["cat", "dog", "bat"]` ‚Äî these lists are for you.

> These are public domain or openly licensed resources, available as **plain-text files** that are easy to parse, easy to preview, and easy to break things with (on purpose).

## üß† Why These Matter

Most student programs start with synthetic or toy data. That‚Äôs fine, but it‚Äôs not how things work outside the classroom. Real-world development involves handling:

- Inconsistent casing (`"Apple"` vs `"apple"`)
- Duplicates
- Encoding issues (ASCII, UTF-8, BOM headaches)
- Huge file sizes
- Odd spacing or punctuation

By giving you these larger lists, we‚Äôre training your brain and your code to survive in the wild.

## üìù Formats You‚Äôll Encounter

All lists are in **plain-text ASCII-compatible formats**, such as:

- `.txt`: One word per line
- `.csv`: Words with metadata (e.g. frequency, part-of-speech)
- `.json`: Nested or flat arrays of words, great for APIs and apps
- `.tsv`: Tab-separated, easier when commas are in the data

These formats are easy to open, parse, and process in **Python, C++, Bash, or even Excel**.

## üí° Pro Tips

- Use these lists to test **search algorithms**, **autocomplete**, **sorting**, **regex**, or **data cleaning** skills.
- Want to simulate a **typing test** or **hangman game**? These are perfect.
- Trying to build a **scrabble solver**? These are your cheat sheets.
- Curious about **prefix trees or tries**? Load one of these and start building.
