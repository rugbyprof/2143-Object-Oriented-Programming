Lesson 1: Setting Up the Game Window

Goal: Understand how to create and manage an SFML window.
• Topics Covered:
• Creating an SFML window (sf::RenderWindow).
• Handling basic events (e.g., window close).
• Setting up a game loop.
• Activity:
• Create a game window titled “Knucklebones.”
• Close the window when the user presses the Escape key.

Lesson 2: Drawing Shapes and Textures

Goal: Learn to draw basic shapes and use textures.
• Topics Covered:
• Drawing sf::RectangleShape, sf::CircleShape, and sf::Sprite.
• Loading and displaying a texture (e.g., a dice face image).
• Activity:
• Display a textured dice face in the center of the game window.

Lesson 3: Capturing and Handling User Input

Goal: Understand how to capture mouse and keyboard input.
• Topics Covered:
• Detecting mouse clicks and keyboard presses.
• Using sf::Event for real-time interaction.
• Activity:
• Allow the user to “click” on a dice face to simulate rolling the dice (e.g., display a random dice face).

Lesson 4: Animations in SFML

Goal: Create basic animations using SFML’s tools.
• Topics Covered:
• Using sf::Clock to manage frame timing.
• Loading and displaying a sequence of images (e.g., animated dice roll).
• Activity:
• Animate the dice roll by cycling through a sequence of frames before displaying the final result.

Lesson 5: Drawing the Game Grid

Goal: Build the game board for Knucklebones.
• Topics Covered:
• Drawing a grid using sf::RectangleShape.
• Positioning shapes and sprites in the grid.
• Activity:
• Create a 3x3 grid to represent one player’s game board.

Lesson 6: Handling Game States

Goal: Introduce game state management.
• Topics Covered:
• Defining and transitioning between states (e.g., Start, Player Turn, Game Over).
• Using enums or simple state management techniques.
• Activity:
• Display a “Start Game” screen, then transition to the game grid when the user presses a key.

Lesson 7: Managing Text and Fonts

Goal: Display text for scores, player names, and instructions.
• Topics Covered:
• Loading and using custom fonts (sf::Font).
• Drawing and updating sf::Text objects.
• Activity:
• Display player names and scores above each grid in the game.

Lesson 8: Working with Sounds and Music

Goal: Add sound effects for dice rolls and game interactions.
• Topics Covered:
• Loading and playing sound effects using sf::Sound and sf::SoundBuffer.
• Adding background music using sf::Music.
• Activity:
• Play a sound when the dice is rolled and another when a dice is placed in the grid.

Lesson 9: Implementing Game Logic

Goal: Code the basic rules and mechanics of Knucklebones.
• Topics Covered:
• Placing dice in the grid based on player input.
• Scoring system and dice multipliers.
• Switching turns between players.
• Activity:
• Implement dice placement and scoring rules, allowing turns to alternate.

Lesson 10: Adding Polish and Finishing Touches

Goal: Complete the game with additional features and polish.
• Topics Covered:
• Adding transitions (e.g., fade in/out effects).
• Implementing a simple menu system (e.g., Start, Restart, Quit).
• Improving visuals with animations and effects.
• Activity:
• Finalize the game, ensuring all features are implemented.
• Add a “Game Over” screen with the option to restart or quit.

Bonus Lessons (Optional)

    1.	Networking: Implement multiplayer Knucklebones using sockets for communication (e.g., SFML’s networking module or another library).
    2.	AI Opponent: Build a simple AI opponent that places dice intelligently.
    3.	Save and Load: Allow players to save their progress and reload games.

Teaching Approach

Each lesson builds on the previous one, with code examples and activities that contribute directly to the final game. By the end, your students will have a complete SFML-based version of Knucklebones and a strong understanding of SFML’s core features.
