## Step 1: Identifying Classes and Responsibilities

**Objective**

The goal of this step is to help students break down the game into its core components (classes) and identify the responsibilities of each class. This foundational work leads to the creation of an initial Class Diagram.

## Identifying Key Classes

Based on the design of the Knucklebones game, here are the primary classes and their responsibilities:

### 1. Game

- Purpose: Manages the overall flow of the game.
- Responsibilities:
- Initialize the game (players, grid, etc.).
  - Manage turns and dice rolls.
  - Check win/loss conditions.
  - Display game state (optional if handled by another class).
- Key Attributes:
  - players: An array or vector of Player objects.
  - grid: A shared Grid object (or separate grids for each player).
  - current_turn: Tracks whose turn it is.
- Key Methods:
  - start()
  - takeTurn()
  - checkWin()

### 2. Player

- Purpose: Represents a player in the game.
- Responsibilities:
  - Maintain personal game data, like score or player name.
  - Interact with the grid and dice via the game.
- Key Attributes:
  - name: Playerâ€™s name.
  - score: Playerâ€™s total score.
  - grid: A personal Grid object (if separate grids are used).
- Key Methods:
  - takeTurn()
  - updateScore(points)

### 3. Grid

- Purpose: Represents the 3x3 grid where dice are placed.
- Responsibilities:
  - Manage placement of dice.
  - Handle scoring logic (e.g., multiplication bonus, dice removal).
- Key Attributes:
  - cells: A 3x3 matrix storing dice values or objects.
- Key Methods:
  - placeDice(column, value)
  - calculateScore()
  - removeOpponentDice(column, value)

### 4. Dice

- Purpose: Simulates rolling a six-sided die.
- Responsibilities:
  - Generate a random number between 1 and 6.
  - Animate dice rolling (optional).
- Key Attributes:
  - value: Current face value of the dice.
- Key Methods:
  - roll()

### 5. UI/Renderer (Optional)

- Purpose: Handles visual representation of the game state.
- Responsibilities:
  - Display the grid, dice, scores, and other game elements.
- Key Attributes:
  - window: The rendering window or context.
- Key Methods:
  - drawGrid()
  - drawDice()
  - drawScore()

**Initial Class Diagram**

Hereâ€™s a textual description of the initial class diagram:

1. Game is the central class that interacts with Player, Grid, and Dice.
2. Player has a one-to-one relationship with a Grid (each player owns a grid).
3. Game owns one or more Dice objects (shared by all players).
4. Grid interacts directly with dice values when placing or removing them.
5. UI/Renderer (if used) interacts with all other classes to display their state visually.

## Practice Exercise

1. Identify any additional classes or components you think might be needed.
   - Examples: ScoreCalculator, InputHandler.
2. Assign responsibilities to those components. 3. Sketch a preliminary Class Diagram using tools like:
   - Online: [draw.io](https://draw.io), [Lucidchart](https://lucidchart.com)
   - Offline: Pen and paper or a whiteboard.

> In the next step, weâ€™ll refine the Class Diagram by adding relationships like associations, aggregations, and compositions to define how these classes interact.ðŸš€
