## Step-by-### Step UML Lesson Using Knucklebones

### Step 1: Identify Classes and Their Responsibilities

- Break down the game design into its key components, focusing on identifying the classes.
- Define the responsibilities of each class, leading to the creation of a Class Diagram.

### Step 2: Class Relationships

- Explore how the classes interact (e.g., associations, aggregations, compositions).
- Enhance the Class Diagram to show relationships like “Player owns a Grid” or “Game manages Players and Dice.”

### Step 3: Sequence Diagrams

- Model the interaction during specific scenarios:
- Example 1: A player taking their turn.
- Example 2: Scoring dice on the grid.
- Teach students how to represent method calls and object lifetimes.

### Step 4: State Diagrams

- Focus on state changes within the game:
- Example: Represent how the game transitions between “Waiting for Input,” “Processing Turn,” and “Game Over.”
- Create a State Diagram for the Game or Player class.

### Step 5: Activity Diagrams

- Show the flow of activities for specific actions:
- Example: Rolling dice and deciding where to place them on the grid.
- Create an Activity Diagram to represent the decision-making process.

### Step 6: Use Case Diagram

- Explore the user perspective, identifying use cases like:
- “Player Rolls Dice.”
- “Game Calculates Scores.”
- Build a Use Case Diagram to highlight user interactions with the game.

### Step 7: Final Consolidation

- Combine the diagrams into a coherent design overview.
- Discuss how the diagrams interrelate and reinforce key OOP principles.

Deliverables for Each Step

- For each step, provide:
  1. Explanations of the concepts.
  2. Partial UML diagrams based on the Knucklebones game design.
  3. Exercises for students, like identifying missing associations or completing a partially drawn diagram.
