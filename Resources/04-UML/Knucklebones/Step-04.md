## Step 4: State Diagrams

**Objective**

The focus of this step is to model the states and transitions for key components of the game using State Diagrams. This provides students with a clear understanding of how an object or system transitions between states based on specific triggers.

## What Are State Diagrams?

State diagrams represent the various states of an object or system and how it transitions between these states due to events or actions.

**Key elements include:**

- States: Represented as labeled rectangles with rounded corners.
- Transitions: Arrows between states, labeled with events that trigger the change.
- Start and End States: Represented as a filled black circle (start) and a circle with a border (end).

## Key Components to Model

### 1. Game State

The Game class transitions between states like:

- Initialization: Setting up players, dice, and grid.
- Waiting for Input: Waiting for a player’s action (e.g., rolling a dice or placing it on the grid).
- Processing Turn: Handling dice placement and scoring.
- Game Over: Determining the winner and displaying results.

2. Player State

The Player class transitions between states like:

- Idle: Waiting for their turn.
- Taking Turn: Rolling dice and placing them on the grid.
- Waiting: Waiting for the game to process their actions.

## Example 1: Game State Diagram

**States:**

1. Start: The game begins.
2. Initialize: Players and grids are initialized.
3. Waiting for Input: Waiting for a player to roll dice or take an action.
4. Processing Turn: The game processes the player’s move, updates the grid, and recalculates scores.
5. Game Over: The game ends, and the winner is determined.

Transitions:

- Start → Initialize: Triggered when the game starts.
- Initialize → Waiting for Input: Triggered after setup is complete.
- Waiting for Input → Processing Turn: Triggered when a player takes a turn.
- Processing Turn → Waiting for Input: Triggered after the move is processed.
- Processing Turn → Game Over: Triggered when all grid spaces are filled.

**Student Exercise - Insert Image Here:**

Include an image of a State Diagram showing states like “Waiting for Input,” “Processing Turn,” and “Game Over” with transitions clearly labeled.

## Example 2: Player State Diagram

**States:**

1. Idle: The player is not taking their turn.
2. Rolling Dice: The player rolls the dice.
3. Deciding Move: The player chooses where to place the dice on the grid.
4. Waiting: The player waits for the game to process their move.

**Transitions:**

- Idle → Rolling Dice: Triggered when the player starts their turn.
- Rolling Dice → Deciding Move: Triggered after dice are rolled.
- Deciding Move → Waiting: Triggered after the player places the dice on the grid.
- Waiting → Idle: Triggered when the turn ends.

## Diagram Placement

**Student Exercise - Insert Image Here:**

Include a diagram showing the player’s states transitioning from “Idle” to “Rolling Dice” to “Deciding Move.”

## How to Create State Diagrams

1. Identify Key States:

   - For the Game class, think about the stages of gameplay.
   - For the Player class, consider what a player does during their turn.

2. Define Transitions:
   - What events or actions cause state changes? 3. Draw the Diagram:
3. Use UML software like:
   - [draw.io](https://draw.io)
   - [Lucidchart](https://lucidchart.com)
   - Or hand-draw the states and transitions.

## Practice Exercise

1. Draw a Game State Diagram:

   - Include at least four states and appropriate transitions.
   - Label each transition with the trigger event.

2. Draw a Player State Diagram:

   - Focus on the states a player transitions through during their turn.
   - Include at least one decision point (e.g., choosing a column).

3. Discussion:
   - How might adding animations or delays affect these state transitions?
   - Can you identify any “hidden” states not explicitly modeled here?

> In the next step, we’ll create Activity Diagrams to show the detailed workflows for specific actions, such as rolling a dice or updating the score. These diagrams will focus on decision-making and branching logic.
