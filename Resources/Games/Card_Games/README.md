# ♠️♥️ Card Game Simulation Lab: Deal, Design, Dominate

“Card games are 90% logic, 10% luck — and 100% chance to learn OOP.”

⸻

## 👀 What’s This?

This lab is your all-access pass to the world of card game simulation in C++. You’ll learn how to build flexible card game logic, print cards to the console, and start building games like War, Blackjack, Poker, or even Go Fish.

This is one of the BEST ways to learn object-oriented design — because cards naturally fit into classes.

⸻

### 🧠 Concepts You’ll Learn

    •	How to represent a card in code
    •	How to shuffle and deal cards
    •	How to print cards (ASCII or symbols)
    •	How to compare values and suits using mod/div math
    •	Class composition vs. inheritance
    •	Thinking like a game designer!

⸻

### 🧱 Suggested Class Structure (Stage 1)

```cpp
// Card.h
class Card {
public:
    int id; // 0 - 51 (or use suit + value directly)
    Card(int id);
    int getValue() const;  // returns 0–12 → Ace to King
    int getSuit() const;   // returns 0–3 → Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades
    std::string toString() const;
};

// Deck.h
class Deck {
private:
    std::vector<Card> cards;
public:
    Deck();
    void shuffle();
    Card deal();
    bool empty() const;
};
```

Let students customize this from here — it’s the base for all games.

### 🔢 Suit & Value Logic with mod/div

Let’s say your Card class holds an id from 0 to 51:

```txt
0  → Ace of Clubs
1  → 2 of Clubs
...
12 → King of Clubs
13 → Ace of Diamonds
...
51 → King of Spades
```

### 🧮 Card Math:

```cpp
value = id % 13; // 0 to 12  → Ace to King
suit  = id / 13; // 0 to 3   → Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades
```

This is simple, efficient, and easy to debug.

Want to make a card printable?

```cpp
std::string suits[]  = {"C", "D", "H", "S"};
std::string values[] = {"A", "2", "3", ..., "K"};

std::string Card::toString() {
    return values[id % 13] + suits[id / 13];
}
```

## 🖨 Bonus: ASCII Cards

You’ve got ascii_cards.txt, ascii_cards2.txt, and even horizontal print code. Use these to:
• Print beautiful card visuals
• Build a hand or deck display system
• Let students visualize gameplay in terminal

Great for War, Blackjack, or just printing 5 random cards.

## 🎮 Card Game Project Ideas

1. War (Classic Showdown)
   • Each player draws one card
   • Higher value wins the round
   • Tie = war! Draw 3 face-down, then 1 up

2. Blackjack
   • Implement hit/stay logic
   • Handle ace as 1 or 11
   • Simulate dealer rules

3. Go Fish
   • Focus on asking, matching ranks
   • Practice vector filtering and sets

4. High Card Game
   • Deal 5 cards
   • Pick highest by value
   • Great starter game

5. Sorting Simulator
   • Draw a hand of 7
   • Sort by suit, then value
   • Good practice with std::sort() and comparison overloads

⸻

## 🧩 OOP Advice for Students

✅ You don’t need to over-engineer. Start simple.

Use composition:
• Deck has a vector<Card>
• A Game has a Deck and some Hands

Avoid this (for now):
• class Deck : public Card ❌ (a deck is not a card)
• class Hand : public Deck ❌ (a hand is not a full deck)

⸻

🧪 Stretch Goals
• Add Jokers or custom cards
• Allow multiple decks
• Implement suit hierarchy (Spades > Hearts > …)
• Add turn-based player logic
• Save/load games with fstream
• Animate card dealing in terminal (frame-by-frame printing)

⸻

## 💬 Final Thoughts

Card games are the ultimate OOP sandbox. They teach design, randomness, data handling, input, logic, printing — and they’re FUN.

So shuffle up, deal some code, and let’s see who wins.
