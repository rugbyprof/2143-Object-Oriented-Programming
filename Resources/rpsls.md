## RockPaperScissorsLizardSpock

Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is a variation of the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors that was popularized by the television show "The Big Bang Theory." The game is played between two players, each of whom simultaneously chooses one of five possible options: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock. The objective of the game is to win by choosing an option that beats the option chosen by the other player.

**The rules of the game are as follows:**

Rock beats Scissors and Lizard
Paper beats Rock and Spock
Scissors beats Paper and Lizard
Lizard beats Paper and Spock
Spock beats Rock and Scissors
The game is played in rounds, with players keeping score of how many rounds they have won. In each round, both players make their selection at the same time, and their choices are compared to determine the winner of that round. If both players choose the same option, the round is a tie and is played again until a winner is determined.

For example, if Player 1 chooses Rock and Player 2 chooses Scissors, then Player 1 wins the round because Rock beats Scissors. If both players choose Lizard, the round is a tie and is played again.

Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock adds two additional options to the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors, which allows for more strategy and variety in gameplay.
