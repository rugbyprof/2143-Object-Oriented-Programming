A card or dice game is a great idea for an OOP assignment. While **inheritance** might not always fit perfectly in card or dice games, it can be useful in specific scenarios. For example, card games could have different **card types** or **player roles**, while dice games could feature different **dice types** or **specialized player actions**. Below are two ideas that could make for great assignments, with and without the use of inheritance.

### 1. **Card Game: "War" with Inheritance**

**Overview**:  
"War" is a simple card game where two players draw cards, and the player with the higher card wins the round. Players keep playing until one runs out of cards.

**Inheritance Use Case**:

- **Base Class: `Card`**: Stores basic information like suit and rank.
- **Derived Classes**: You can introduce variations by creating different card types (e.g., `SpecialCard` that can modify the game's rules or values).
- **Player Inheritance**: Players can inherit from a base class (`Player`) and have different strategies for drawing cards, e.g., `AggressivePlayer` or `ConservativePlayer`.

**Classes**:

- **Card**: Base class for all cards, with attributes for suit, rank, etc.
- **Player**: Manages the deck and actions of the player.
  - Derived classes could handle different strategies.
- **Deck**: Manages shuffling and dealing cards.

**Example Class Structure**:

```cpp
class Card {
protected:
    std::string suit;
    int rank;
public:
    Card(std::string s, int r) : suit(s), rank(r) {}
    virtual int getRank() const { return rank; }
    std::string getSuit() const { return suit; }
};

class SpecialCard : public Card {
public:
    SpecialCard(std::string s, int r) : Card(s, r) {}
    int getRank() const override {
        // Special rule: If rank is 2, make it the highest.
        return (rank == 2) ? 15 : rank;
    }
};

class Player {
protected:
    std::string name;
    std::vector<Card> hand;
public:
    Player(std::string n) : name(n) {}
    virtual Card drawCard() = 0;  // To be overridden by derived classes
};

class AggressivePlayer : public Player {
public:
    AggressivePlayer(std::string n) : Player(n) {}
    Card drawCard() override {
        // Strategy: Always draw the first card.
        return hand[0];
    }
};
```

**Assignment Ideas**:

- Implement a basic version of the game with just `Card` and `Player` classes.
- Add different types of players and cards to extend the game using inheritance.
- Add a scoring system where the highest card wins, or introduce rounds where special cards change the rules.

### 2. **Dice Game: "Yahtzee" (Without Inheritance)**

**Overview**:  
Yahtzee is a classic dice game where players roll five dice and aim to make specific combinations (e.g., three-of-a-kind, full house, etc.). Students could implement this game using various classes without requiring inheritance.

**Classes**:

- **Die**: Represents a single die with methods to roll it.
- **DiceSet**: Represents a collection of five dice and provides methods to roll them all or selectively.
- **ScoreCard**: Tracks a player's score for each combination (e.g., full house, small straight).
- **Player**: Manages the dice rolls and the scorecard for the player.

**Example Class Structure**:

```cpp
class Die {
private:
    int value;
public:
    Die() : value(1) {}
    void roll() { value = rand() % 6 + 1; }
    int getValue() const { return value; }
};

class DiceSet {
private:
    std::vector<Die> dice;
public:
    DiceSet() : dice(5) {}
    void rollAll() {
        for (auto &die : dice) {
            die.roll();
        }
    }
    std::vector<int> getValues() const {
        std::vector<int> values;
        for (const auto &die : dice) {
            values.push_back(die.getValue());
        }
        return values;
    }
};

class ScoreCard {
private:
    std::map<std::string, int> scores;
public:
    void recordScore(const std::string &category, int score) {
        scores[category] = score;
    }
    int getScore(const std::string &category) const {
        return scores.at(category);
    }
};

class Player {
private:
    std::string name;
    DiceSet dice;
    ScoreCard scoreCard;
public:
    Player(const std::string &n) : name(n) {}
    void takeTurn() {
        dice.rollAll();
        // Logic for selecting a score category would go here.
    }
};
```

**Assignment Ideas**:

- Students can implement the basic game rules and extend it with different game modes or score strategies.
- Implement a class to handle player turns and the game's overall flow.
- Add additional methods in the `ScoreCard` class to evaluate different scoring combinations, such as three-of-a-kind, full house, etc.
