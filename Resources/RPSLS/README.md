# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock (RPSLS)

> _"An expansion of Rock Paper Scissors to reduce the number of possible outcomes. It’s very simple." – Sheldon Cooper_

Welcome to **Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock**, a ridiculous but _gloriously nerdy_ version of the classic game. Originally concocted by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla, then popularized by _The Big Bang Theory_, RPSLS increases the complexity and reduces the chances of a tie — and gives you more excuses to throw weird hand gestures at your classmates.

## 🤓 Why Use This in Class?

Because it's perfect for beginner coders! Students can:

- Practice **conditionals** (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Upgrade to **dictionaries** or **match/case**
- Add a UI (terminal, web, buttons — you name it)
- Build a **scorekeeper**, **timer**, or **multiplayer mode**
- Flex some **ASCII art** or emojis 💥🦎🖖

## 🧠 The Five Sacred Symbols

| Gesture      | Defeats                |
| ------------ | ---------------------- |
| **Rock**     | Scissors 🪓, Lizard 🦎 |
| **Paper**    | Rock 🪨, Spock 🖖      |
| **Scissors** | Paper 📄, Lizard 🦎    |
| **Lizard**   | Paper 📄, Spock 🖖     |
| **Spock**    | Rock 🪨, Scissors ✂️   |

This means there are **10 unique win conditions**, 5 symbols, and only one rule:

> **Nothing beats Sheldon.**

Just kidding. The actual rule: you win if your hand defeats your opponent’s according to the chart above.

## 🎮 Example Matchups

- Rock **crushes** Scissors
- Scissors **decapitates** Lizard
- Lizard **poisons** Spock
- Spock **vaporizes** Rock
- Paper **disproves** Spock (because science)

Yes, this is all canon.

## 🧪 Ideas for Student Projects

- [ ] Create a `play_game()` function that runs a best-of-5 tournament
- [ ] Add AI with different difficulty levels
- [ ] Add emojis or hand-drawn ASCII versions
- [ ] Build a command-line or web-based interface
- [ ] Use OOP to create a `Player` class
- [ ] Implement cheat codes like "🦖 > everything"

## 💡 Teacher Tips

Use this as a “sneaky learning” assignment:

- Start with a simple `if/else` structure
- Have students draw the decision tree
- Introduce `dict[choice]` for clean logic
- Challenge: implement it with zero `if` statements at all

## 🧙 Final Words of Wisdom

In programming — and in RPSLS — elegance comes from **thinking ahead**, not just brute-forcing every match-up.

Also, don’t forget:

> Spock _"vaporizes"_ Rock.  
> That’s _way_ cooler than just beating it.

**Now go forth and code. But beware the Lizard. He’s sneaky.**
