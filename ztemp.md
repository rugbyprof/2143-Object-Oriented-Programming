I created a folder called `BaseLessons` and placed each of the 10 lessons you created within. Up to now you've given me so much content to absorb, Im overwhelmed and excited. SFML was such a pain in the ass when I attempted to use it in class, and SDL2 has been smooth (which also scares me)! In addition to these 10 tiny code chunks (with explanations) you have given so much its overwhelming. For example (and all of these groups are not listed in chronological order):

- In addition to `BaseLessons` I also have what I call `baseSnippets`, that are md walkthoughs discussing the minimum amount of code necessary to implement these topics:
  - 01-base_window.md
  - 02-draw_grid.md
  - 03-grid_w_error_check.md
  - 04-window_w_text.md
- Then I wanted to go from one big function to refactoring and adopting an OOP design (because, well... this class is OOP). And we progressed with:
  - v1_basic_grid
  - v1a_basic_grid_plus
  - v2_refactored_engine
  - v3_grid_toggle
  - v4_game_of_life
- The examples kept on coming!
  - You gave a nice write up on the **game loop** and understanding how that all fits together with event handling.
  - I grasped the concept about colors being similar to terminal escape sequences and we simply turn them on and off.
  - I have some cool color cycle code (one of wich I turn the square into a bouncing ball).
  - And last but not least, I have some kick ass mouse lessons!

Why am I telling you all this? Because you generated everything (with my miniscule help) and I would really like someone to organize it for me.
