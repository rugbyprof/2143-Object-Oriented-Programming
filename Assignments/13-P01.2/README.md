## Part 2 - Basic Class Implementations

#### Due: 04-08-2025 (Tuesday)

1. **Objective:**

   - Implement the basic structure of your classes in C++ **without** full CRUD functionality.
   - Focus on constructors, getters, setters, and basic data representation.

2. **Requirements:**

   - **Header/Source** files for your classes:
     - **Model Class** (e.g., `Candy`), which defines the data fields (id, price, category, etc.).
     - **JSONDBManager** class stub:
       - Contains the filename, a `json` member, and placeholders for the main methods (`load()`, `save()`, etc.) but not fully implemented yet.
     - **CandyManager** (or similar “manager” class), containing stubs or minimal logic for calling the `JSONDBManager` methods.

3. **Suggested Tasks:**
   - Ensure your classes compile and can be instantiated in a simple `main.cpp`.
   - Write a minimal test that just creates objects and prints them to `cout`.

## Deliverables

- In the folder `P01` that is in your assignments folder create a document called: `02-Basic_Classes.md` and place all your requirements in there.
