## Part 1: UML Design

#### Due: 04-01-2025 (Tuesday)

1. **Objective:**

   - Develop a **UML Class Diagram** showing all major classes, their relationships, and key methods/attributes for the JSON database manager.

2. **Requirements:**

   - A **UML diagram** (in PDF or image format) of the classes (e.g., `Candy`, `JSONDBManager`, `CandyManager`, or equivalent).
   - A short description (no more than a page) explaining the reasoning behind your design.

3. **Suggested Tasks:**

   - Identify which classes handle data, which handle JSON file interactions, and which coordinate the workflow.
   - Decide on relationships: inheritance vs. composition/aggregation.
   - Determine whether certain classes need to handle error-checking or data validation.

## Deliverables

- In the folder `P01` that is in your assignments folder create a document called: `01-Uml_Design.md` and place all your requirements in there.

## UML Resources

### UML Video Resources

1. Lucidchart YouTube Channel

- The team behind Lucidchart has a series of beginner-friendly videos that show how to create various UML diagrams. These videos often demonstrate common UML notations (classes, relationships, etc.) in a straightforward way.

2. Seffline’s “UML Class Diagram” (YouTube)

- A concise introduction to UML class diagrams. Good if you want a quick primer on the basics: classes, fields, methods, inheritance, and associations.

3. “UML 2.0 Tutorial” from edureka! (YouTube)

- edureka! publishes a lot of free content. Their UML 2.0 video provides a broader overview of UML diagrams (class, sequence, use case, etc.) in a single session.

4. Udemy or Coursera

- Searching “UML” on these platforms yields some free or low-cost courses. They aren’t exclusively videos but often contain video lectures, quizzes, and resources.

### UML Diagram Software

1. Lucidchart (Online)

- A popular browser-based diagramming tool. Very user-friendly; it has a free tier that students can typically use for smaller projects. Supports real-time collaboration.

2. draw.io (diagrams.net) (Online)

- Completely free and open source. It runs in the browser or can be installed as a desktop app. Great for quick UML sketches or more detailed diagrams. It also has integration with Google Drive, Dropbox, and more.

3. Visual Paradigm Online (Online)

- Offers a web-based diagram editor with a free tier. Particularly known for its UML support and extensive templates.

4. PlantUML (Text-based, multiple platforms)

- Lets you write UML in a pseudo-code markup language. The tool then generates the diagrams. It’s terrific for version control because the diagram is basically plain text. You can use the online PlantUML server or run it locally.

5. StarUML (Desktop)

- A desktop-based UML tool that’s relatively affordable for individual/student licenses. Has a modern interface and robust UML diagram features.

6. Pen & Paper

- Old-school but often underrated. A quick hand-drawn diagram scanned or photographed can be just as valuable for brainstorming or preliminary design.

### Pro Tips:

Make sure you use software that:

- Keeps you aware of official UML elements (e.g., class boxes, relationship lines).
- Possibly supports generating code or reading it from the diagrams (like StarUML or Visual Paradigm).
- Fits easily into your workflow. For many students, something free, online, and collaborative (like draw.io) is a great start.
