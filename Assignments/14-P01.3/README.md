## Part 3: Basic JSON Integration (Loading & Saving)

#### Due: 04-15-2025 (Tuesday)

1. **Objective:**

   - Implement file-based loading and saving in your `JSONDBManager`.
   - Successfully read a sample JSON file into an in-memory `json` object and save it back.

2. **Requirements:**

   - **JSONDBManager** with working `load()` and `save()` methods.
   - Sample JSON file (e.g., `candy_store.json`) containing a few items.
   - A demo in `main.cpp` showing that the JSON file is read, manipulated minimally, and written back.

3. **Suggested Tasks:**
   - Confirm `load()` prints or logs the loaded data.
   - Confirm `save()` overwrites or updates the JSON file correctly.
   - Handle basic errors (e.g., file not found).

## Deliverables
