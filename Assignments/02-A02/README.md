## Assignment 2 - Slack 

#### Due: 01-26-2025 (Sunday by 11:55)

## Getting Setup

All of these are important! So do them with expedience.

If you have had me before, and this seems **TL;DR** make sure you:

1. Are on my slack channel: https://griffin-courses.slack.com
2. Add yourself to the class roster
3. Make sure you add an image or avatar to your slack profile. (These will also be placed into the class roster).

### Team Chat

The first step in doing well in any of my courses is establishing a base of communication. Why? Not everything can be done while we are in class.

Assignments will (and should) be challenging. Therefore, you will need help from me and your classmates. Using [Slack](https://slack.com)<sup>2</sup> (a chat client) provides a communication portal after class and regardless of where you are. I realize that most work gets done in the evening and off campus. By using Slack,you don't have to wait until the lab is open, or until I have office hours.

You can ask questions multiple ways on Slack. Either on our public class channel, or privately between users. If you post a question on the public channel, your fellow students can help with an answer. This is good, because most questions revolve around interpretation of an assignment: "What did Griffin mean when he asked \***\*\_\_\*\***?" These questions help everyone interpret an assignment correctly, and I can jump in to give a definitive answer. You can also privately ask me a question on a direct channel. I will do my best to answer in an expedient amount of time. Some days I may answer immediately, and some days I may not answer at all. I try my best, but I will also not be a slave to slack :) I mostly will answer quickly, even late at night.

You should have gotten an invite already from me. Accept it. If you didn't, ask me for another invite. [Here](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users) is a getting started guide to help you use slack. Slack is an app. It can be installed OR viewed via a web browser using a URL.

#### Slack provides

- Team chat (class members and myself).
- Code highlighting for snippets so we can share code and read it better.
- File sharing simply by dragging and dropping.
- Private channels so you can discuss things without everyone seeing (even I can't see).
- Polls so we can vote on things (mainly for me).

So, **NO email!** Unless I specifically ask. Slack is your communication conduit for this class.

#### Slack Recommendation

1. I **highly** recommend installing slack on your mobile device as well as your own computer. I often upload help, or code suggestions on Slack in the evening or on weekends. Having slack on your mobile device will give you the best chance of getting the `alert` or notification that something was done.
2. **The students that monitor our slack channel and participate in discussions almost alway do better. I've used slack since it was established almost 10 years ago and I can say with a high level of confidence that students who participate on Slack to better in the course.**
3. **YOU WILL** update your profile so your avatar in chats shows either an image of you, or an avatar that ends up on your Github repo's main page.

Now that we have our communication client set up, we probably need to start getting the actual programming environment ready! We will be doing many things from the command line this semester. Windows is not known for it's command line prowess, so we need to give it some assistance.

> Notes:
>
> - <sup> **1**. Your repository name and your Github username are **NOT** the same thing.</sup>
> - <sup> **2**. I should be able to click your repo link, and it will take me to your course repository. NOT your github home page.
> - <sup> **3**. Uploading an image of you (with your face in it) will help me learn names faster!</sup>
