## Homework - Classes & Objects

#### Due: 03-25-2025 (Tuesday)

This homework assignment focuses on the fundamental concepts of classes and objects. You will explore the definition of classes, how objects are instantiated, and the role of constructors and destructors in managing an object's lifecycle.

---

## Objectives

1. **Understand** the definition of a class and what it means to instantiate an object.
2. **Explain** the purpose of constructors and destructors.
3. **Describe** the object lifecycle from creation to destruction.
4. **Demonstrate** basic class design with a minimal coding example.

---

## Part A: Conceptual Questions

1. **Definition of a Class and an Object**

   - What is a class in object-oriented programming?
   - What is an object, and how does it relate to a class?

2. **Constructors and Destructors**

   - Define a constructor. What is its role in a class?
   - Define a destructor. Why is it important in managing an objectâ€™s lifecycle?

3. **Object Lifecycle**
   - Briefly describe the lifecycle of an object from instantiation to destruction.
   - Why is it important for a class to manage its resources (e.g., memory) during its lifecycle?

---

## Part B: Minimal Coding Example

> **Note:** You should use C++ for this assignment. Focus on the structure and clarity of your class design.

**Task:**

- Design a simple class called `Creature` (or a D&D-themed class such as `Goblin`) that includes:
  - A private data member (e.g., `health` or `name`).
  - A constructor that initializes the data member(s).
  - A destructor that prints a message indicating the object is being destroyed.
  - A public method that displays the object's state.

> Include a short explanation (2-3 sentences) describing how your class uses a constructor, a destructor, and how the object lifecycle is managed.

## Part C: Reflection & Short-Answer

Answer the following in a few sentences:

1. Importance of Constructors:
   - How do constructors help ensure that an object starts its lifecycle in a valid state?
2. Role of Destructors:
   - Explain why destructors are necessary, especially in languages without automatic garbage collection.
3. Lifecycle Management:
   - What could happen if a class does not properly manage its resources during its lifecycle?

## Deliverables

- Create a folder called `H01` within your assignments folder and place all work there.
- Submit your responses as a text file, PDF, or Markdown document.
- Include answers to all conceptual questions, your minimal coding example (or pseudocode), and your reflection responses.
