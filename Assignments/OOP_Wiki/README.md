I want you to start your own OOP wiki that provides definitions and examples of all of the OOP concepts we cover in class. There is a comprehensive list of terms below that is larger than the concepts or terms we will have time cover in class. You assignment is to create a wiki in your repository and start adding the terms we cover in class to your wiki.

The list of links below give you access to tutorials that will walk you through creating a wiki. The skill of creating a wiki goes beyond just this class, the format of wikis are used for code documentation and even for books and tutorials.

# **OOP Wiki Deliverables** ðŸš€

As part of your Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) coursework, you will be creating a collaborative wiki to document relevant OOP definitions and concepts. Below are the key deliverables and guidelines for structuring your wiki.

### **1. Create a Wiki in Your OOP Repository**

- Use GitHubâ€™s built-in **Wiki** feature within your OOP repository.
- Ensure your wiki is publicly accessible (or as required by the course guidelines).

### **2. Organize Your Wiki Using a Sidebar Index**

- The **sidebar** serves as the navigation menu and should include an index linking to all OOP definitions and concepts.
- Organize your index logically, grouping related topics together (e.g., Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism under "Core OOP Principles").

### **3. Structuring Your Wiki Pages**

- Each page can contain **one or more definitions**, but ensure content remains well-structured and easy to navigate.
- If multiple concepts are covered on one page, use **clear section headings** to separate them.

### **4. Page Content Requirements**

Each wiki page should include:

- **Clear definitions** and explanations of the topic.
- **Links to external resources** (such as official documentation, tutorials, and additional readings).
- **Images and diagrams** where appropriate to illustrate concepts.
- **References** to relevant course materials, textbooks, or other sources.

### **5. Best Practices for Writing and Formatting**

- Use **concise and precise language** while maintaining clarity.
- Format pages using **Markdown or HTML** for easy readability.
- Link related pages within the wiki to create a **well-connected knowledge base**.
- Keep information **organized and structured**, avoiding unnecessary duplication of content.

By following these deliverables, your wiki will become a **valuable reference for both you and your classmates**, reinforcing key OOP concepts while also providing a collaborative learning experience.
