## Assignment 2 - Commenting C++ Code 
#### Due: 09-01-2020 (Tuesday @ 9:30 a.m.)

### Overview

This assignment is more about breaking the ice with github, with a little to do with programming. You will NOT be allowed to attend class after the due date until this is done. 

### Comment A Program

- Using the [main.cpp](./main.cpp) file in this folder, 
- Apply the proper comments using the guidelines from here: [comments](../../Resources/01-Comments/README.md).

### Upload Your Commented Program

- Create a folder in your `Assignments` folder called `02-CommentedCode` 
- Place your commented `main.cpp` file into this `02-CommentedCode` folder.


### Your Assignments Folder

- Everytime you upload a new assignment to your github repo, it should be in a folder with the name given to it by the assignment. 
- Each folder should begin with its assignment number. This will keep the folders in order after creation and upload.
- Your folder will also have a `README.md` file in its root. This `README.md` will contain a table that is basically a "directory" for every assignment in the assignments folder. Below is an example (link will not work since the Assignments folder is not in my repo):

| Number | Folder                              | Description                            |
| :----: | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 02     | [02-CommentedCode](./CommentedCode) | Assignment to ensure proper commenting |


- Upload your assignment to github BEFORE the due date.
