## Part 5 - Integration, Final Testing, & Presentation

#### Due: 04-29-2025 (Tuesday)

1. **Objective:**

   - Combine all parts into a polished project.
   - Thoroughly test all functionalities, handle edge cases, and present your solution.

2. **Requirements:**

   - **Final Project Folder** with:
     1. UML diagram (updated if changes were made during implementation).
     2. All source code (`.hpp`, `.cpp`, `main.cpp`).
     3. Sample JSON database file.
     4. **Short Report** (1â€“2 pages) summarizing design decisions, lessons learned, and known limitations.
   - **Demo or Documentation** showing sample runs (console output or screenshots).

3. **Suggested Tasks:**
   - Test with different JSON inputs (including empty arrays).
   - Consider special cases (e.g., ID collisions, invalid fields).
   - Create a small user menu in `main()` (optional but helpful for demonstration).

## Deliverables

- In the folder `P01` that is in your assignments folder create a folder called: `Final_Project` and place all source code, UML diagrams, and a READM.md explaining / summarizing the project with instructions on how to use your DB helper.
