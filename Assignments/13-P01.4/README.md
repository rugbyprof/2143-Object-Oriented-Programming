## Part 4 - CRUD Functionality

#### Due: 04-22-2025 (Tuesday)

1. **Objective:**

   - Fill out the **Create, Read, Update, Delete** methods in `JSONDBManager` and connect them through `CandyManager`.

2. **Requirements:**

   - **Add, Get, Update, and Delete** operations fully implemented.
   - **CandyManager** methods (e.g., `createCandy()`, `readCandy()`, etc.) that call the lower-level DB manager.
   - Tests in `main.cpp` demonstrating each operation against the JSON file.

3. **Suggested Tasks:**
   - Ensure that `createCandy()` properly adds a new entry to the JSON array.
   - Implement `readCandy()` to fetch a record by `id`.
   - Provide `updateCandy()` that modifies fields (like `price` or `title`).
   - Confirm `deleteCandy()` removes the correct object from the array.
