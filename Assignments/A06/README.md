## Assignment 6 - Bouncing Screen Saver Clock
#### Due: Friday November 12<sup>nd</sup> by classtime.

### Overview:

Using the starter code included [here](./clock_starter) or using your own Assignment 05, write a clock class that extends / inherits from `Group` and `sfml::drawable` so you can easily print your clock to a game screen. There are plenty of examples in the [Resources](../../Resources) folder for you to follow. 

### Some Additions:

- Your clock will be paired with a rectangle to serve as it's background. 
- Since your clock will extend group, your clock text and rectangle can be printed together.
- Make your clock configurable. This means there should be methods for changing:
    - Font color
    - Font size
    - Background color
    - Border color
    - Clock position
- Make your clock(s) have a movement feature that will allow it to float around the screen bouncing off the walls.

### Deliverables:

- Turn in a copy of your completely commented code at the beginning of class.
- The name of your `cpp` file should be `clocks.cpp`.
- Make sure your code makes it onto github in your assignments folder under a folder called `A06`.
- Along with your code, your folder should contain 1 animated gif of your clocks running.
- Name your gif `clocks.gif`.

> https://www.getcloudapp.com/ has a free "gif capture" feature to record a portion of your screen. You can use this (or some other software of your choice) to create an animated gif of your clock running. The gif should include only the portion of your screen that has the clock.
