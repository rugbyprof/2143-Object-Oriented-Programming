Your example isn’t wrong; handling mouse input in ncurses does indeed require a few steps, which can feel verbose. However, we can certainly clean it up by abstracting the logic. Let’s break down what each step is doing and then create a structure that simplifies and organizes mouse input handling.

Why Mouse Handling in ncurses Has Layers

    1.	Checking for KEY_MOUSE: This is necessary because getch() will return KEY_MOUSE when there’s a mouse event, but it won’t know if it’s a click, scroll, or other mouse action without additional checks.
    2.	Capturing the Mouse Event: getmouse(&event) retrieves details of the mouse event. It’s a bit lower level, but it’s needed to access the event’s x and y coordinates.
    3.	Checking bstate for Button Press: ncurses supports various mouse actions (e.g., clicks, double-clicks), so it uses bstate to specify which button state triggered the event (e.g., BUTTON1_CLICKED).

Simplifying Mouse Handling with a Dedicated Mouse Handler Function

To make this cleaner, you can encapsulate mouse handling in a function that:
• Checks for KEY_MOUSE.
• Retrieves the x and y coordinates.
• Maps mouse clicks to specific handlers, just like you did with keyboard input.

Here’s an example of how you could design this:

Step 1: Define Mouse Handlers

Set up functions that handle specific areas or actions in response to mouse clicks.

void handle_button_click(int x, int y) {
// Do something when button is clicked
mvprintw(0, 0, "Button clicked at %d, %d", x, y);
}

void handle_grid_click(int x, int y) {
// Handle a click on a grid area
mvprintw(1, 0, "Grid clicked at %d, %d", x, y);
}

Step 2: Create a handle_mouse_event Function

This function will encapsulate the logic of checking for KEY_MOUSE, getting the event, and determining what to do based on the click location.

#include <map>
#include <ncurses.h>

// Example mouse handler function
void handle_mouse_event() {
MEVENT event;
if (getmouse(&event) == OK) {
int x = event.x;
int y = event.y;

        // Check for button click and call the appropriate function
        if (event.bstate & BUTTON1_CLICKED) {
            if (/* condition for button click */) {
                handle_button_click(x, y);
            } else if (/* condition for grid click */) {
                handle_grid_click(x, y);
            }
        }
    }

}

In this setup, handle_mouse_event captures the coordinates only if the KEY_MOUSE and BUTTON1_CLICKED conditions are met, and then it routes the click based on x and y conditions.

Step 3: Integrate into the Game Loop

You can now check for KEY_MOUSE in the game loop and call handle_mouse_event to process the click, simplifying the main loop.

int main() {
initscr();
keypad(stdscr, TRUE);
mousemask(ALL_MOUSE_EVENTS, NULL); // Enable all mouse events
noecho();
curs_set(0);

    int ch;
    while ((ch = getch()) != 'q') {
        if (ch == KEY_MOUSE) {
            handle_mouse_event();  // Delegate mouse handling
        }

        // Other keyboard handling or game logic
        refresh();
    }

    endwin();
    return 0;

}

Explanation of the Simplified Approach

    •	Encapsulated Logic: handle_mouse_event() keeps all mouse handling logic in one place, reducing clutter in the main loop.
    •	Simplified Routing: Conditions within handle_mouse_event allow routing clicks to specific functions (handle_button_click, handle_grid_click) based on the x and y coordinates.
    •	Consistent Structure: This mirrors the approach used for keyboard events by assigning specific actions to specific mouse events or areas, giving it a cleaner, event-driven feel.

Additional Tips for Streamlining

    1.	Map Areas to Functions: If you have many interactive areas, you could map areas (like a grid or button) to handler functions, similar to your approach with keyboard actions.
    2.	Mouse Event Abstraction: For very complex games, a MouseHandler class could further organize events, grouping actions by areas, making the main game code even cleaner.
    3.	Avoid Excessive Checks: If only BUTTON1_CLICKED matters for your game, restrict bstate to that button to avoid unneeded checks.

This setup provides an organized and modular way to handle mouse input without excessive nesting or conditional checks, making the code easier to read and extend!
