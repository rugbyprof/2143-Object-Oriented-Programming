Window management in ncurses can be a bit tricky, but incorporating it into your NcursesGame class or as a separate WindowManager class can help keep your code organized and flexible. Here’s a breakdown of some approaches for managing windows effectively in your game.

Window Management: Integrate into NcursesGame or Separate?

	•	Option 1: Incorporate Basic Window Management into NcursesGame:
	•	If your game only needs one or two extra windows, it’s often sufficient to have NcursesGame handle both stdscr and a few additional windows.
	•	This simplifies switching between stdscr and other windows, as well as handling basic setup and teardown.
	•	Option 2: Use a Separate WindowManager Class:
	•	If your game uses multiple windows or if you want dynamic window creation, having a separate WindowManager class gives you more control and flexibility.
	•	A WindowManager class can also help manage transitions between stdscr and custom windows.

Transitioning Between stdscr and Other Windows

In ncurses, you can create additional windows using newwin() and work within each window independently. The transition between stdscr and another window (or back) typically involves a few steps:
	1.	Switch Focus to the window you want to draw in.
	2.	Draw Content relative to that window’s coordinates.
	3.	Refresh the specific window using wrefresh() to update only that window, or refresh() if you’re drawing in stdscr.

When you want to switch back to stdscr, you just stop using the window-specific functions and return to stdscr functions like mvprintw().

Basic Window Management Example

To give you a framework, here’s an example of an NcursesGame class that includes methods to create, switch between, and delete windows.

NcursesGame with Window Management

```cpp
#include <ncurses.h>
#include <map>
#include <string>

class NcursesGame {
public:
    NcursesGame();
    ~NcursesGame();

    void initialize();
    void cleanup();
    
    // Window management methods
    WINDOW* create_window(int height, int width, int starty, int startx);
    void delete_window(WINDOW* win);
    void focus_window(WINDOW* win);
    void refresh_all();

    // Drawing methods
    void draw_text(WINDOW* win, int x, int y, const std::string& text);
    void draw_char(WINDOW* win, int x, int y, char ch);

private:
    bool is_initialized;
    std::map<std::string, WINDOW*> windows;  // Optional: Store windows by name for easy access
};

// Constructor and destructor
NcursesGame::NcursesGame() : is_initialized(false) {}
NcursesGame::~NcursesGame() { cleanup(); }

// Initialization and cleanup
void NcursesGame::initialize() {
    if (is_initialized) return;
    initscr();
    noecho();
    curs_set(0);
    keypad(stdscr, TRUE);
    start_color();
    is_initialized = true;
}

void NcursesGame::cleanup() {
    for (auto& win_pair : windows) {
        delwin(win_pair.second);
    }
    if (is_initialized) endwin();
}

// Window management
WINDOW* NcursesGame::create_window(int height, int width, int starty, int startx) {
    WINDOW* win = newwin(height, width, starty, startx);
    windows[std::to_string(reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(win))] = win;
    return win;
}

void NcursesGame::delete_window(WINDOW* win) {
    if (win) {
        delwin(win);
        windows.erase(std::to_string(reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(win)));
    }
}

void NcursesGame::focus_window(WINDOW* win) {
    wclear(win);     // Clear only the window
    wrefresh(win);   // Refresh only the window
}

void NcursesGame::refresh_all() {
    for (auto& win_pair : windows) {
        wrefresh(win_pair.second);  // Refresh each window individually
    }
    refresh();  // Also refresh stdscr if needed
}

// Drawing methods
void NcursesGame::draw_text(WINDOW* win, int x, int y, const std::string& text) {
    if (win) {
        mvwprintw(win, y, x, text.c_str());  // Draw within window
    } else {
        mvprintw(y, x, text.c_str());  // Fallback to stdscr
    }
}

void NcursesGame::draw_char(WINDOW* win, int x, int y, char ch) {
    if (win) {
        mvwaddch(win, y, x, ch);  // Draw within window
    } else {
        mvaddch(y, x, ch);  // Fallback to stdscr
    }
}

Usage Example

In your main game loop, you can create windows and switch between them as needed.

int main() {
    NcursesGame game;
    game.initialize();

    // Create a few windows
    WINDOW* info_win = game.create_window(5, 30, 0, 0);  // Top-left for info
    WINDOW* game_win = game.create_window(20, 50, 5, 5); // Main game area

    // Main loop
    while (true) {
        // Draw in the info window
        game.draw_text(info_win, 1, 1, "Score: 100");
        game.focus_window(info_win);

        // Draw in the game window
        game.draw_text(game_win, 1, 1, "Game in progress...");
        game.focus_window(game_win);

        // Refresh all windows and stdscr
        game.refresh_all();

        // Game logic, input handling, etc.
    }

    game.cleanup();
    return 0;
}

Explanation

	•	Window Creation and Focus:
	•	create_window creates a window, and focus_window focuses on and refreshes only that window. This allows for selective updating, reducing flicker.
	•	Transition Between Windows and stdscr:
	•	To switch back to stdscr, simply pass nullptr as the win argument in the drawing methods (draw_text() or draw_char()).
	•	refresh_all:
	•	This method calls wrefresh on each created window and refreshes stdscr, ensuring all windows are drawn and visible.

Summary

	•	Manage Windows Within NcursesGame: The class manages all windows and their lifecycle.
	•	Smooth Transitions: focus_window and refresh_all provide flexibility for focusing on a specific window or refreshing everything.
	•	Simplified Main Loop: By consolidating window and ncurses management into NcursesGame, you keep the main game loop clean and focused.

This setup keeps ncurses complexities organized and will make it easier for your students to build and manage more complex UI elements in their games!
